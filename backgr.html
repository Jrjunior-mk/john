	<h2 class="title"><b>MOUNTAINS</b></h2>
	<pre class="history"><i><b>
		 They define landscapes, people risk their lives to climb them, and they can even make their 
	         own weather.
		 The mighty chunks rise all over the world, including the oceans. They usually have  steep,
		 sloping sides and sharp or rounded ridges, and a high point, called a peak or summit.
		 Most geologists classify a mountain as a landform that rises at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) 
		 or more above its surrounding area. A mountain range is a series or chain of mountains that
                 are close together.

	<h2 class="title">MOUNTAINS FORMATION</h2>
	<pre class="history"><i><b>
	 The world's tallest mountain ranges form when pieces of Earth's crust—called plates—smash against 
	 each other in a process called plate tectonics, and buckle up  like the hood of a car in a head-on 
	 collision. The Himalaya in Asia formed from one such massive wreck that started about 55 million
	 years ago. Thirty of the world’s highest mountains are in the Himalaya. The summit of Mount Everest,
         at 29,035 feet (8,850 meters), is the highest point on Earth.


         The tallest mountain measured from top to bottom is Mauna Kea, an inactive volcano on the island of
	 Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. Measured from the base, Mauna Kea stands 33,474 feet (10,203 meters) 
	 tall, though it only rises 13,796 feet (4,205 meters) above the sea.


          Volcanic mountains form when molten rock from deep inside the Earth erupts through the crust and 
	 piles up on itself. The islands of Hawaii were formed by undersea volcanoes, and the islands seen 
	 above water today are the remaining volcano tops. Well-known volcanoes on land include Mount
	 St. Helens in Washington State and Mount Fuji in Japan. Sometimes volcanic eruptions break down 
	 mountains instead of building them up, like the 1980 eruption that blew the top off Mount
	  St. Helens.

         When magma pushes the crust up but hardens before erupting onto the surface, it forms so-called 
         dome mountains. Wind and rain pummel the domes, sculpting peaks and valleys. Examples include the 
	 Black Hills of South Dakota and the Adirondack Mountains of New York. Plateau mountains are similar
	 to dome mountains, but form as colliding tectonic plates push up the land without folding or
         faulting. They are then shaped by weathering and erosion.

         Other types of mountains form when stresses within and between the tectonic plates lead to cracking
        and faulting of the Earth's surface, which forces blocks of rock up and down. Examples of 
	 fault-block mountains include the Sierra Nevada in California and Nevada, the Tetons in Wyoming,
         and the Harz Mountains in Germany.</b></i></pre>

 <h2 class="title">Impact of Mountains on Habitats and Geopolitics</h2>
<pre class="history"><i><b>
	 Mountains often serve as geographic features that define natural borders of countries. Their height
	 can influence weather patterns, stalling storms that roll off the oceans and squeezing water from 
	 the clouds. The other side is often much drier. The rugged landscapes even provide refuge—and
	 protection—for fleeing and invading armies.
